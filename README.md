# Micro:bit Sound Compass

#Aims of the App

Help the user identify which direction they are facing using sound

## Details and controls

* Calibrate the compass (annoying, but it has to be done)
* Rotate the Micro:bit and you will hear the pitch rises as you become close to NESW and then lowers as you get further away.
* There is a different pitch for each of the four directions.
* There is also the direction displayed for whichever of the four directions you are facing.
